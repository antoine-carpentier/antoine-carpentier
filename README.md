Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm Antoine Carpentier,  
I'm a developer currently living in Chicago, Illinois.

I've created [Custom Tools for Revit](https://github.com/antoine-carpentier/AC-Revit-Toolbox), a log management software in three parts ([Part 1](https://github.com/antoine-carpentier/Optimus-NewForma-Procore-Log), [Part 2](https://github.com/antoine-carpentier/AWS-Optimus-I) and [Part 3](https://github.com/antoine-carpentier/AWS-Optimus-I)), as well as a [Raspberry Pi automated cat laser toy], among other things.  
I am a developer experienced in C#, Visual Basic, Python, Javascript and SQL but always open to learning more!

You can also find various JS scripts I have written over at [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/754006-antoine-carpentier).

When I'm not writing code, you can find me playing board games with friends, renovating my place or entertaining my cats!
